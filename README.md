# Intro

*What do we want?*
develop rational design principles for neural network architectures on general curved background with the extendability to quantum situation, i.e.
1. how to choose architecture to speed up the learning ?
2. how to avoid exploding/vanishing gradients?
3. how many layers and nodes in each layer?
4. how we can transfer learning to different data?
